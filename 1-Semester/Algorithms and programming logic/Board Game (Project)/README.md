## Exercise Description

### 1. Validation of Attack Positions
Checks if there are attack positions in a 5x5 matrix. It simulates a scenario where pieces can attack others based on their position.

- **Input**: 5x5 matrix representing positions.
- **Output**: Message indicating whether or not there are attack positions.

### 2. Vector Sorting
Sorts a vector of 15 elements using a basic method of sorting by exchanging adjacent values.

- **Input**: Vector of integers.
- **Output**: Sorted vector.

### 3. Conclusion of Experimental Results
Checks the consistency between two sets of experiments represented by a vector of 50 elements, comparing pairs of values.

- **Input**: Vector of 50 elements representing experiments.
- **Output**: Message indicating whether the result is conclusive.
